    ABOUT_ME:`Hello! I'm Leonardo. My interest in programming sparked during high school when I developed an inventory system in **VBA**, and recently, I completed my undergraduate studies in **Systems Engineering** at *Universidad del Norte*.

Throughout my education, I participated in events like *Expof√≠sica* with a realistic physics simulator. I also excelled in **programming marathons** at the institution and had the opportunity to engage in university-supported initiatives.
    
On a personal level, I am fascinated by **automation** and **artificial intelligence**. I've worked on projects to *control* parts of my house with a **virtual assistant**. Additionally, I enjoy developing **mods** and exploring new hobbies like **wood carving**.
